> Set the [Hyper](https://hyper.is) tab title to the folder you are in

It is kind of irritating to see a truncated title, you just need to see the current directory name.

### Install

```bash
$ hyper i hype-title
```

Or, you can install `hype-title` manually by adding it to the plugins list in your `~/.hyper.js` config file.
